I made this project to practice both python and my quadratic equation solving skills.
Once the file in run, the instructions are self-explanatory.

First choose a difficulty:
  1: coefficient 'a' always equals 1, coefficients 'b' & 'c' don't exceed 50, no need for the quadratic formula
  2: coefficient 'a' doesn't exceed 10, coefficients 'b' & 'c' don't exceed 100, no need for the quadratic formula
  3: coefficients don't exceed 100, the quadratic formula should be used
  4: coefficients are always between 100 and 1000, the quadratic formula should be used

Next choose how many problems you want to solve (this is capped at 50).
Then enter your answer with up to 3 digits after the decimal.
If there are two roots enter your answer separated by a space.

Have fun solving! I plan on converting this into JS and implementing this into a web interactable version so the visuals are nicer.

There's a problem right now where on difficulties 1 & 2 the answers will almost include a 1 or 2 so there is absolutely no challenge.
Ex. 2x^2 + 38x + 36 | Answer: -1 & -18
Ex. 1x^2 + 7x + 10 | Answer : -5 & -2
I did a test run of 5 problems on difficulty 1 and all the answers had a 1 or 2 which shouldn't be the case.
This is because they are the most common answers and the number generator for difficulty 1 & 2 runs until the answers have no decimals. 
Since the most common answers will have a 1 or 2 the problems with these answers are generatred the most often.
